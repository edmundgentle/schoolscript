# This file returns the mapping:
#         Perl_Decimal_Digit(cp)
# 
# where 'cp' is one of the 460 code points in Unicode Version 6.1.0 for which
# the mapping is not to the null string.  Note that this mapping is
# accessible via the function prop_invmap('Perl_Decimal_Digit') in
# Unicode::UCD
# 
# This file gives the mapping of all code points which represent a single
# decimal digit [0-9] to their respective digits, but it has ranges of 10
# code points, and the mapping of each non-initial element of each range is
# actually not to "0", but to the offset that element has from its
# corresponding DIGIT 0.  These code points are those that have Numeric_Type=
# Decimal; not special things, like subscripts nor Roman numerals.
# 
# The format of the non-comment portions of the main body of lines of this
# file is: START\tSTOP\tMAPPING where START is the starting code point of the
# range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if omitted, the range has just
# one code point; MAPPING is what each code point between START and STOP maps
# to.  Numbers in comments in [brackets] indicate how many code points are in
# the range (omitted when the range is a single code point or if the mapping
# is to the null string).

# The mappings must be modified to get the correct values by adding the code
# point ordinal number to each one that is numeric.

# The name this swash is to be known by, with the format of the mappings in
# the main body of the table, and what all code points missing from this file
# map to.
$utf8::SwashInfo{'ToPerlDecimalDigit'}{'format'} = 'a'; # some entries need adjustment
$utf8::SwashInfo{'ToPerlDecimalDigit'}{'missing'} = ''; # code point maps to the null string

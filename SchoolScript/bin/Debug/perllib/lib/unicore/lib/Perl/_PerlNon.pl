# This file returns the 52 code points in Unicode Version 6.1.0 that match:
# 
#         \p{_Perl_Non_Final_Folds}
# 
#     Meaning: Code points that particpate in a multi-char fold and are not
#     the final character of said fold
# 
# perluniprops.pod should be consulted for the syntax rules for this,
# including if adding or subtracting white space, underscore, and hyphen
# characters matters or doesn't matter, and other permissible syntactic
# variants.  Upper/lower case distinctions never matter.
# 
# The format of the lines of this file is: START\tSTOP\twhere START is the
# starting code point of the range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if
# omitted, the range has just one code point.  Numbers in comments in
# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.

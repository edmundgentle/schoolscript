#         \p{Block=Mathematical_Operators}
#         \p{Blk=Math_Operators}

# A colon can be substituted for the equals sign, and anything to the left of
# the equals (or colon) can be combined with anything to the right.  Thus,
# for example,
#         \p{Blk: Mathematical_Operators}
# is also valid.

# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.

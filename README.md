schoolscript
============

An IDE for scripting languages where someone can write code and run it in a single window.


Current Development
-------------------

The current version of SchoolScript is a prototype. There are a number of features which should be added in order for it to become close to useful:

- Input into "terminal window"
- Error reporting from code
- Why isn't it closing sometimes?
- Tutorials
- Line numbering
- Make code colouring better
- Fix undo/redo

What I have developed so far has been as a side project, and has got the project to a decent place, although it isn't really anything useful until the previous features are added.

The code is written in C# and uses builds of various languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl) to run the code.
